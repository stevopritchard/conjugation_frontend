## Â¡Conjugado!

This project is a React front-end that's paired with an [Express server](https://github.com/stevopritchard/conjugation_backend).

### What's this project for?

I created this project to test my ability to create a small full-stack web application that would also be useful in my Spanish studies.

### Getting up and running

You can download and launch the code on localhost:3000, however to register a user and access the app itself, you'll need to run the [Express back-end](https://github.com/stevopritchard/conjugation_backend) after setting up an SQL database.
